- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @victorsmoreschi, I am an undergrad at Economics and in the last 3 years (2020-2023) I have been studying corporate finance. Nowadays I work at an Asset Backed Investment Fund, but a professor, Dimitri Bianco and an internal analysis for myself concluded that Quant Finance is the best fit for what I would like for my future. In this way, I started studying econometrics and quickly I realized that other knowledges would be needed, so I am trying to learn econometrics while getting better at math and programming.
